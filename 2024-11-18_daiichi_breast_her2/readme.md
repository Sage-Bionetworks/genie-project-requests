## About the project

This is a request from Tony Wu on the possible number of HER2 ultra-low. Cases we may have.  This can't be directly assessed in GENIE yet, so we pulled the superset of those with IHC = 0 and ISH negative cases from BPC, and projected those into main GENIE.

## Getting started

The main workflow of the project is in `main.R`.  Run those steps to reproduce the anslysis.

## Built with

R version 4.4.2.  This project does not use `renv` or other reproducibility-enhancing techniques beyond git.
