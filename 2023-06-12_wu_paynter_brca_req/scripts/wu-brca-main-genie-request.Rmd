## Introduction

This requests pertains the accurals over time of patients with BRCA mutations in main GENIE, and whether those patients are a part of BPC cohorts.  Full cohort criteria include:

1. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
2. Only somatic mutations.
2. Cancers are classified according to the oncotree primary node, also known as the tissue type (Breast, Pancreatic, etc).  These are classified into two groups:
    - Known impact - Those where BRCA mutations have a known impact.  This includes Prostate, Ovarian, Breast and Pancreatic cancers.
    - Unknown impact - All other types (full list below).
    
Additionally, there are some important caveats for this report:

1. We have limited to consortium releases, since this project would involve AACR members and others with access to that data.
2. "Release date" is currently when the object was created in synapse for releases before 5.0.  For later releases we use the wiki-recorded time found at (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3380222/wiki/583302).  These turn out to be close so probably not a big deal (see last item).

)

plotly_total_all <- accrual_plotter(

```

## Total accruals

We show the number of patients and the number of patients with BRCA mutations in each figure.  These plots are semi-interactive, so feel free to mouse over them for more information about each point.

```{r, include = T}
plotly_total_all
```


```{r, include = T}
plotly_total_brca
```

**Observation:**  There's clearly something going on between release 8 and 9 for the BRCA mutations and/or my code summarizing them.  For this request that's not a problem, we can estimate accrual rate using only consortium releases 9 and over (where things appear consistent), which is exactly what I'll do in the upcoming sections.

## Accural by site

### Figure

The following image shows the accrual for (1) all BRCA mutations (2) only those associated with a cancer that has a known impact, see above and (3) those associated with any other cancer type.

The rates are annotated in (very small) text for each site.  These are from a linear model fit to consoritum releases 9.1 and later.  These are sorted by accrual rate, highest rate sites going first.  All rates are number of participants added per **year**.

```{r, include = T, fig.height = 10}
gg_site_accrual
```

**Observations:** 

- There are clearly some sites, and particularly ones with excellent bioinformatics teams (UHN, JHU), which had a decrease in the number of BRCA cases found over time.  This could be a reflection of improved quality control (for example, reclassifying some mutations that were not truly somatic).
- Several sites have no BRCA mutations detected, which may indicate a coding error somehwere.


```{r}
dft_mut_totals_center <- dft_mut_counts_center %>% 
  # forget the 14.6 consortium because it has a drop (prepare for public)
  filter(!(release %in% "14.6-consortium")) %>%
  group_by(center, known_cancers_f) %>%
  arrange(major_number, release) %>%
  slice(n()) %>%

  select(center, release, known_cancers_f, n_brca) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = known_cancers_f, values_from = n_brca) %>%
  arrange(desc(All))

```

### Table view

In the following table we show the total number accumulated at the latest release for each site:

```{r, include = T}

  mutate(across(.cols = everything(), .fns = as.character)) %>% 
  huxtable(.) %>%
  huxtable::set_align(value = "right")
```

dft_releases %>% slice(1) %>% pull(release_sum) %>% `[[`(1) %>% pt_list_helper

pt_list_helper <- function(release_summary) {
  release_summary %>%
    filter(variant %in% 1) %>%
    select(patient_id, center, oncotree_primary_node)
}

# example:
# dft_releases %>% slice(1) %>% pull(release_sum) %>% `[[`(1) %>% pt_list_helper

dft_pt_list <- dft_releases %>%
  # Same rule of thumb - releases before 9 seem strange.
  mutate(release_num = readr::parse_number(major)) %>%
  filter(release_num >= 9) %>%
  filter(!(minor %in% c("14.6-consortium", "13.2-consortium", "14.0-public"))) %>%
  mutate(
    sum = purrr::map(.x = release_sum, .f = pt_list_helper)
  ) %>%
  select(-release_sum) %>%
  unnest(sum)

dft_pt_list %<>% 
  # oncotree primary node grouping here?
  group_by(patient_id, center) %>%
  arrange(major, minor) %>%

dft_pt_list %<>%
  select(
    center,
    patient_id,
    oncotree_primary_node,
    # latest_release_seen = minor
  )

dft_pt_list %<>% 
  group_by(patient_id, center) %>%
  summarize(
    known_cancer = if_else(
      any(oncotree_primary_node %in% vec_known_brca),
      T, F, NA
    ),
    unknown_cancer = if_else(
      any(!is.na(oncotree_primary_node) & !(oncotree_primary_node %in% vec_known_brca)),
      T, F, NA
    ),

```


```{r}

  select(center, patient_id, oncotree_codes)
  
dfp_brca_unknown <- dft_pt_list %>%
  filter(unknown_cancer) %>%
  select(center, patient_id, oncotree_codes)

dfp_brca_known_bpc <- left_join(
  dfp_brca_known,
  dft_bpc,
  by = c(patient_id = "record_id")
) %>%
  filter(!is.na(cohort)) %>%
  rename(bpc_cohort = cohort)

dfp_brca_unknown_bpc <- left_join(
  dfp_brca_unknown,
  dft_bpc,
  by = c(patient_id = "record_id")
) %>%
  filter(!is.na(cohort)) %>%
  rename(bpc_cohort = cohort)
```


```{r}
fs::dir_create(path = here("output"))

readr::write_csv(
  x = dfp_brca_known,
  file = here("output", "brca_known_impact.csv")
)

readr::write_csv(
  x = dfp_brca_unknown,
  file = here("output", "brca_unknown_impact.csv")
)

readr::write_csv(
  x = dfp_brca_known_bpc,
  file = here("output", "brca_known_impact_bpc.csv")
)

readr::write_csv(
  x = dfp_brca_unknown_bpc,
  file = here("output", "brca_unknown_impact_bpc.csv")
)

```


Two patient lists are attached:

- `brca_known_impact.csv` - Participants known to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and a cancer where these alterations have a known impact (see above).
- `brca_unknown_impact.csv` - Participants know to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and a cancer where these alterations have an unknown impact.



## BPC overlap

To look at BPC overlap we pulled the latest consortium release for the 6 cohorts with releases.  This includes `r n_bpc` unique participants including `r n_bpc_multi_cohort` who are in more than one BPC cohort.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  These lists currently look over all releases to find participants with BRCA mutations.  This means that there may be some participants who were reclassified later and may not be suitable for selection.  We should discuss this - an alternative is to use only the latest consortium release for each site.







```{r}
dft_date_diffs <- dft_releases %>%
  rename(release = minor) %>%
  mutate(
    release_date_wiki = release_date,
    release_date_folder = str_sub(minor_createdOn, 1, 10),
    release_date_folder = lubridate::ymd(release_date_folder),
    date_diff = lubridate::time_length(
      release_date_folder - as_date(release_date_wiki),
      unit = "day"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(release, date_diff, release_date_wiki, release_date_folder) %>%
  filter(!is.na(date_diff))

gg_date_diff <- ggplot(
  data = dft_date_diffs, aes(x = date_diff)) + 
  stat_ecdf() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Folder date - Wiki date (days)")
```


## Side curiousity: Folder dates vs release dates

For releases after 5 we have a wiki page with the true release dates.  The question is "how far off are folder creation dates compared to the gold standard curated date?".  This may be relevant should we ever want to analyze early releases which may not have such dates.  Here's the CDF for the difference in dates between these:

```{r, include = T}
gg_date_diff
```

Generally they're very close, and not that far off in either direction.  So as long as we make the wildly unlikely assumption that practices before 5.0 were similar we could probably use folder dates fairly confidently.
